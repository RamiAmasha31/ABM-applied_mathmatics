# Research Project: Epidemic Spread Analysis in a Gerbil Population

## Introduction

This research focuses on analyzing the spread of a bacterial epidemic within a gerbil population, which includes multiple bacterial strains. Using an agent-based model, we simulate the behavior of individual gerbils in the face of the epidemic and perform a dynamic analysis of the epidemic's impact on its spread within the group.

## Key Focus Areas

1. **Agent-Based Model (ABM) for Unique Simulation**: Unlike statistical models, we use an agent-based model to describe the unique dynamics of each gerbil and how it affects the entire population.
2. **Multi-Strain Epidemic**: We investigate the impact of an epidemic with multiple strains on the gerbil population by exploring the interactions between different strains. The research aims to uncover insights into the dynamics of co-infection, strain competition, and potential implications for the overall health and resilience of the gerbil community.
3. **Parameter Exploration**: Using the agent-based model, we aim to investigate the effect of various parameters on the epidemic's spread, such as the contact rate between individuals and the infectivity of different viral strains. Through systematic exploration with the agent-based model, the research aims to deepen our understanding of the fundamental factors shaping the epidemic dynamics within the gerbil population.

## Research Goal

This research project employs an agent-based model to simulate the unique dynamics of multi-strain viral epidemics among gerbils and address the central research question: What causes the high prevalence of Bartonella bacteria in the gerbil population? By examining individual behaviors, multi-strain interactions, and parameter sensitivities, the research aims to provide important insights into the broader field of infectious disease modeling and deepen our understanding of the factors influencing epidemic dynamics in animal populations.

## Collaboration

The research will be conducted in collaboration with Prof. Hadas Hawlena from Ben-Gurion University, and the supervisor is Prof. Guy Katriel.
